# Challenge11

In this project, I analyze the financial and user data of MercadoLibre, the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America. With a focus on driving revenue and growth, I employ clever data preparation, analysis, and visualizations to unveil valuable insights for the company. The key components of this analysis are Seasonality Analysis, Correlation of Stock Price and Search Traffic, Prophet Forecast Model for Search Traffic, and Revenue Forecast.

## Usage

Clone the repository and Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command in your terminal:

```python
  jupyter lab
```

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb file.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to visualize depictions of seasonality, evaluate how the company's stock price correlates with its Google Search traffic, and produce a Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

Lastly, visualize the forecast for the company's future revenue in a plot and generate a sales forecast for the finance division, including the total expected return for a specific time period.

Read the comments and text documentation within the notebook to understand the analysis and findings.
